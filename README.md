# BDOProfit
Fan Website for Black Desert Online

The goal of this website is to give players a calculations tool on an in-game craft/recipe, to determine if it will be profitable or not.
Using a self made MySQL relational database, all recipes/crafts will already have their determined sub materials, images and their required quantities. Just simply input their marketplace values and the website will do the calculations.
